# my python Library

This is the python Library.
The Bat file should open the file explorer and make it easier for you "the user" to navigate and find what you search
This program was purposefully made to teach you python.

**Notice: There will always be more small or big aditions**

_Note: Works on Pydroid on Smartphones "as i know android":
Android does not open the file in a compiler, it simply shows the files content on a Tkinter Specialised window._
